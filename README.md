# Introduction

The Crypto Clustering project aims to determine whether cryptocurrencies are influenced by 24-hour or 7-day price fluctuations through unsupervised learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering. The project also investigates the effect of dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on the clustering process.

# Instructions

1. Load and preprocess the data.
2. Scale the data using StandardScaler.
3. Identify the optimal value for K through the elbow method.
4. Cluster cryptocurrencies using K-means on the original scaled data.
5. Apply PCA to reduce the dataset to three principal components.
6. Determine the best K value using the PCA-transformed data.
7. Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means on the PCA-reduced data.
8. Visualize and compare the results with hvPlot.

# Findings

The project includes the following visualizations:

# Conclusion
The project examines the impact of reducing the number of features on K-means clustering. By comparing the clustering results from the original data with those from the PCA-reduced data, the effect of dimensionality reduction on the clustering process becomes clearer.
